# EtherOps

**EtherOps** is a sophisticated Ethereum analysis toolkit designed to assist developers, auditors, and enthusiasts in interacting with and analyzing Ethereum smart contracts. This tool integrates functionalities for retrieving smart contract source codes, compiling them for analysis, estimating gas usage, reviewing transaction histories, and performing preliminary security vulnerability assessments.

## Key Features

- **Smart Contract Source Retrieval**: Automatically fetches the source code of smart contracts from Etherscan.
- **Smart Contract Compilation**: Utilizes Solc to compile smart contract source code, allowing for further analysis.
- **Gas Usage Estimation**: Provides estimates on gas usage for smart contract deployment and function executions.
- **Transaction History Analysis**: Retrieves the transaction history of a specified contract, aiding in understanding its activity over time.
- **Vulnerability Checks**: Performs basic checks for common security vulnerabilities within the smart contract code.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your system
- An Ethereum node access URL (e.g., via Alchemy or Infura)
- An Etherscan API key for fetching contract source codes

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/etherops.git
cd etherops
```

Create a .env file in the root directory of the project and add your Ethereum node URL and Etherscan API key:

PUBLIC_ENDPOINT_URL='https://eth-mainnet.alchemyapi.io/v2/YOUR_ALCHEMY_KEY'
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY='YOUR_ETHERSCAN_API_KEY'

### Usage
To use EtherOps to analyze a smart contract, simply modify the main.js file to include the contract address you're interested in. Then run:

```bash
node main.js
```

Example: Analyzing a Smart Contract
Fetch and Compile Contract Source Code:
EtherOps can retrieve the source code of any verified smart contract from Etherscan, compile it, and prepare it for further analysis.

Estimate Gas Usage:
Before deploying or interacting with a contract, understanding the potential gas cost is crucial. EtherOps estimates the gas required for these operations.

Transaction History:
Understanding a contract's activity can provide insights into its reliability and usage patterns. EtherOps fetches the contract's transaction history for this purpose.

Security Vulnerability Checks:
EtherOps performs basic security checks to identify common vulnerabilities, such as reentrancy or improper access controls, within the contract code.
